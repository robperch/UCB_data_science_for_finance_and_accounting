    "## **Predicting Bank Failures Using Machine Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "***Project Overview***\n",
    "\n",
    "The United States Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) maintains user faith in the banking system by insuring deposits at select financial institutions up to $250,000. This is generally complemented by an in depth monitoring and risk assessment, to hold financial institutions accountable to just banking standards, and manage turbulent times, all with the end goal of limiting the economic impact of a bank failure. \n",
    "\n",
    "To assist with risk mitigation, the FDIC assigns a \"Bank Score\" to all insured institutions, which is a measure of \"forward-looking risk measures\" as well as historical performance (*FDIC Risk Based Assessments*, FDIC.gov). This is already a highly complex statistical model that relies heavily on reviewer discretion and a rigid scorecard, rather than specific bank data or indicators. This creates an opportunity to explore the potential of applying a machine learning model to FDIC collected data to ultimately predict bank health and supplement professional skepticism when analyzing these financial institutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Can the FDIC implement Machine Learning models to perform additional anaylsis of large financial institutions for riskiness?** The FDIC's 2023 budget alone is $2.409 billion, specifically indended to \"modernize and enhance the FDIC's information technology infrastructure\" (*FDIC Board Approves 2023 Operating Budget*, FDIC.gov). Embodying AI to assist with regulatory practices could save time and improve accuracy for an institution crucial to American Financial Instutions, while reducing costs in the long run. This model categorizes large financial institutions (small banks have a separate scoring system) as risky or safe, based on publicly available banking data. FDIC scores large financal institutions risk between 0 and 100, though for purposes of banking and the importance of using healthy institutions, we define the risky/safe cutoff as **75** as opposed to 50. We use publicly available data provided by the FDIC via the Homeland Infrastructure Foundation. We acknowledge that this data is from 2016, meaning it does not contain banking data or newer institutions. However, the model and fields are still collected and reported by the FDIC, and once obtaining current data, one could apply this model to draw meaningful conclusions going forward."
