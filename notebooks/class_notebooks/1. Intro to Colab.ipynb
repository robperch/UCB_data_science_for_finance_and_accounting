Google Colab is an environment in which you can write [Jupyter Notebooks](https://ipython.org/notebook.html) without needing to install Python on your computer, tablet, or phone.\n",

    "This notebook will give some examples of basic programming in Python. The next notebook in this series will introduce some concepts from the Python Data Analysis Library [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) which we will use throughout the course.\n"
