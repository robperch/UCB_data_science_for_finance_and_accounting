    "# Loading Data into Colab\n",
    "\n",
    "In this final notebook, we'll go over a number of ways to load CSV data into Colab. This is the one area where Colab is unfortunately more difficult than to use compared with running Python on your own computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This difficulty stems from the fact that we need to make the data we are loading available to our Colab Runtime (the virtual machine that is running our Python code). Because the Colab Runtime is an anonymous virtual machine in the cloud, it has the same permissions to access your files as does any anonymous random person on the internet (hopefully none!). We will need to jump through some hoops to either directly provide the data to the Colab Runtime or to make our data accessible to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've listed several ways to load data into Colab below. For any assignments, I will ask that you use Method 1 because that makes it easy for me to run your code myself."

    "# Method 1: Loading from Google Drive by Link Sharing\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest method for loading data into a Colab notebook is to upload it to Google drive, make it share-able with anyone who has a link, and then use a version of that link in Colab.\n",
    "\n",
    "The down-side of this method is that anyone on the internet who has that link can now access that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "* Upload your data file to Google Drive.\n",
    "* Enable link access to everyone in the world(!).\n",
    "  * Select the file that you uploaded and click \"Get Sharable Link\".\n",
    "  * Change the access mode from \"Restricted\" to \"Anyone with the link\".\n",
    "* Copy the link.\n",
    "  * This is link to open the file in Google Drive.\n",
    "  * We will want to create a link to download the file directly.\n",
    "* Extract the file ID.\n",
    "  * The copied link will be something of the form ``https://drive.google.com/file/d/XXX/view?usp=sharing``\n",
    "  * The ``XXX`` part is the Google Drive File ID.\n",
    "* Create a download link.\n",
    "  * Replace the ``XXX`` in ``https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=XXX`` with the file ID.\n",
    "  * This is your download link.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "As a concrete example, the following is a link to open a test CSV file in Google Drive (the link that you get from clicking \"Copy link\").\n",
    "```\n",
    "    https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GpMDgogFAnCDpw0iRMTbUUfbWZTu6kzB/view?usp=sharing\n",
    "```\n",
    "The file ID for this file is\n",
    "```\n",
    "    1GpMDgogFAnCDpw0iRMTbUUfbWZTu6kzB\n",
    "```\n",
    "The direct download link is therefore \n",
    "```\n",
    "    https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1GpMDgogFAnCDpw0iRMTbUUfbWZTu6kzB\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can directly load this file into ``pandas`` using ``read_csv``."

    "Google provides [this example code](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/snippets/sheets.ipynb#scrollTo=k9q0pp33dckN) to load a Google Sheets spreadsheet into Colab. The mechanism is clunky, and is probably not better than just exporting the Google Sheet as a CSV and then uploading that to either Drive or Colab."
